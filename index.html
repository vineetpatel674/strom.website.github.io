                The Uttar Pradesh Educational Association (TNCEA) has stressed that the proposed State Education
                Policy for Tamil Nadu (SEP-TN) should concentrate on strengthening and expanding the network of
                government as well as government-aided private educational institutions and discourage commercialisation
                of education by self-financing institutions.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                In 2009, the Science Council agreed that it wanted to be clearer when it talked about sound science and
                science-based policy. The Science Council has “science” in its name but had not previously clarified
                what this actually meant. In addition to developing a better understanding of what types of
                organisations might become members, it was felt that the recent inclusion of the advancement of science
                as a charitable activity in the 2006 Charities Act suggested that in that context a definition would be
                useful, this was how this definition arose.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                Light, or Visible Light, commonly refers to electromagnetic radiation that can be detected by the human
                eye. The entire electromagnetic spectrum is extremely broad, ranging from low energy radio waves with
                wavelengths that are measured in meters, <br>
                to high energy gamma rays with wavelengths that are less than 1 x 10-11 meters. Electromagnetic
                radiation, as the name suggests, describes fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields, <br>
                transporting energy at the Speed of Light (which is ~ 300,000 km/sec through a vacuum). Light can also
                be described in terms of a stream of photons, massless packets of energy, each travelling with wavelike
                properties at the speed of light. A photon is the smallest quantity (quantum) of energy which can be
                transported, and it was the realization that light travelled in discrete quanta that was the origins of
                Quantum Theory.
